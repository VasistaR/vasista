## Forking the Website

Feel free to fork the website. It's the default Jekyll template with minor CSS modification. However, make sure you edit the analytics ID in [`_includes/analytics.html`](_includes/analytics.html) so that your website's views are not logged into my account. You can also fork the original repository.
