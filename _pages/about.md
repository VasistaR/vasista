I am currently an incoming computer science undergraduate at the [University of California: Santa Cruz](https://cs.ucsc.edu) Baskin School of Engineering. I am also an active independent researcher and founder.

I have interned at [Macrometa](https://macrometa.com), working on building a sales development pipeline for significantly increasing company revenue through optimization of sales development processes.

As an independent researcher, I work on research in turbulence classification in the field of aerospace engineering and fluid dynamics. Aside from that I work on research in machine learning, neural networks, and computational physics.

I have publicly available work on arXiv and conference proceedings of my paper in machine learning, computational physics, and bioinformatics will be available soon on IEEE Xplore.

When I'm not locked in on work, I like going to [hackathons](https://devpost.com/r-vasista07), running my public benefit startup [MapConnect](https://mapconnect.org), and staying in touch with technology and the startup scene. I  serve as the Student Commissioner of the Economic Development and Trade Commission for the City of Milpitas and as the Chief Information Officer of [ExpertiseNPO](https://expertisenpo.com), an educational nonprofit, teaching over 500+ youth so far.
